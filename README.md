Plotly challenge


Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  This dataset catalogs microbes that colonize in human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species(we define them as OTUs for this study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


First we created a horizontal bar chart showing top 10 OTUs found within individuals.  



Next we created a bubble chart that shows OTU IDs, the sample values used, and OTU names.




We also display the metadata of each OTU.  Through the dropdown menu you can go through each OTU ID (this will also change the bubble chart).
